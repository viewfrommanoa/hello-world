# hello-world
marks any progress made in py and hopefully it becomes useful at some point
i don't think any of it makes sense at all, as of 2017.5.28
note: no coding background whatsoever, and no training except at a UH summer program in the 1990s
note2: this kills my weekends
note3: should i just stick with ipython or bother with github, since i'm in no shape to collaborate in any way
